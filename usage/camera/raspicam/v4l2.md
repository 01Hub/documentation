## Using the V4L2 driver

The V4L2 driver provides a standard Linux driver for accessing camera features. This is the driver needed to use the Raspberry Pi camera range as, for example, webcams.

The V4L2 driver provides a standard API on top of the firmware-based camera system.


### Installing the V4L2 driver

Installation of the V4L2 driver is automatic. It is loaded as a child of the VCHIQ driver, and once loaded it will check how many cameras are attached and then create the right number of device nodes.

### Testing the driver

There are many Linux applications that use the V4L2 API, the kernel maintainers provided test tool is called `Qv4l2` and can be installed from the Raspbian OPS repositories as follows:

`sudo apt install Qv4l2`

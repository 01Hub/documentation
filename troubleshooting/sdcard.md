# Having problems creating the SD card?

For the huge majority of users, the SD card is what holds all the software makes the Pi work. It needs to be correctly set up prior to using.

## Did you buy a preimaged SD card?

Some companies or Ebay sellers provide preimaged SD cards which can be useful for people who are unable to image the card themselves. However sometimes these SD card can be out of date, or have older software on them than the current release, and this can sometimes cause problems. 

It's perfectly OK to overwrite a preimaged card with a newer image.

## No idea where to start?

To make installing an OS really easy, we have produced a piece of software called Raspberry Pi Imager which is available on all major platforms. This makes creating your SD card very simple, you just need to run it, choose which OS you want, select the SD card you want to write to and press Write!

To get the Raspberry Pi Imager software, visit our [downloads page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/).

## Don't know which OS to install?

The Raspberry Pi imager will give you a list of the possible OS installs. In the huge majority of cases the one you want is the first in the list, Raspberry Pi OS, 32bit version. This is the one we do development on and is constantly updated and bug fixed to ensure the best user experience.

If you want to install a Media centre OS, LibreElec is a great option, but there are also OS's installs for Retro gaming, and third party OS's like Ubuntu.

## Having trouble imaging your SD card?

If you have followed the Raspberry Pi Imager instructions and something has failed (this is very unusual), you can post the problem on our forums where there is loads of help available. See [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums)
